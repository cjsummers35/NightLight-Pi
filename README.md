# NightLight-Pi

This is a project for building a night light with a raspberry pi. 
When there is light in a room the led will be off and when there is low to no light the led will turn on.
There will be a switch that can also turn the led on and off even in light.


## Components:
- Rasperry Pi
- breadboard
- wires
- resistor
- capacitor
- photoresistor
- led
- button

In the light.py file there is code that makes the photoresistor work with.
The program outputs a value assosiated with how much light is present.
If the light gets too dark the program will print some info from a test file on my pi.

In the LED_button.py there is code that allows for an led to be turned on and off with a button.
